Things I have learned at Bloc:
1. Console is my best friend when trying to debug Javascript
2. Don't give up, regardless how slow or stuck I am just keep trying
3. Code everyday, a day off can be momentum-killer
4. HTML, CSS are easy
5. Javascript is so hard :( , but it's so important
6. Git is so cool
